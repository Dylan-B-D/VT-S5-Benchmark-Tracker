# Voltaic Season 5 Benchmark Tracker

A local benchmark tracker for Voltaic Season 5, that gets the scores directly from the game files, built with Tauri, using a React frontend. This is still work in progress and may have issues. The score requirements and scenario names are fetched from a gist, so changes do not require the app to be updated.
